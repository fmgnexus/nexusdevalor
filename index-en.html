<!-- Testimonial 1: Cecília Parente -->
<div class="testimonial-block">
<blockquote>
I had the honor of working with Flávio for about two years, when he was primarily responsible for the relationship with our consulting firm. His leadership and deep understanding of the complexities of the tobacco sector were fundamental to the success of this partnership. Flávio demonstrated a remarkable ability to listen and manage tensions, transforming guidance into effective actions for the company. A striking example was his role in the negotiation that postponed the requirement for electronic invoices for small rural producers for two years — with a significant strategic impact. His loyalty and ability to deal with the sensitivities of the National Congress and the Executive Branch are qualities that I deeply admire.

                                I had the honor of working with Flávio for about two years, when he was primarily responsible for the relationship with our consultancy. His leadership and deep understanding of the complexities of the tobacco sector were fundamental to the success of this partnership. Flávio demonstrated a remarkable ability to listen and manage tensions, transforming guidelines into effective actions for the company. A striking example was his role in the negotiation that postponed for two years the requirement of electronic invoices for small rural producers — with great strategic impact. His loyalty and ability to deal with the sensitivities of the National Congress and the Executive are qualities I deeply admire.

With extensive knowledge and the ability to connect different sectors, he contributed decisively to our institutional strengthening. His leadership, results, and innovation were marked by the unprecedented achievement of LIFE certification in agribusiness — which symbolizes socio-environmental excellence and genuine commitment to biodiversity and corporate responsibility.

                                Flávio Goulart has always demonstrated an exceptional ability to forge partnerships between companies and civil society organizations, focusing on concrete results. He played a decisive role in bringing SPVS and large corporations like BAT and JTI together, which allowed significant advances in the corporate environmental agenda, including the restoration of 350 hectares with BNDES support and the LIFE Biodiversity certification.

                                With dedication and a transformative vision, Flávio was essential in the creation and execution of the pilot project that introduced the Rural Professional Apprenticeship Program in the Family Agricultural Schools (EFAs) of Rio Grande do Sul. This pioneering work paved the way for a new educational model in EFAs, inspiring initiatives throughout Brazil and contributing to the change in the Apprenticeship Law.

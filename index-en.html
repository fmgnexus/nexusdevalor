                                I had the honor of working with Flávio for about two years, when he was primarily responsible for the relationship with our consulting firm. His leadership and deep understanding of the complexities of the tobacco sector were fundamental to the success of this partnership. Flávio demonstrated remarkable listening skills and tension management abilities, transforming guidelines into effective actions for the company. A striking example was his role in the negotiation that postponed the requirement for Electronic Invoicing for small rural producers for two years — with a great strategic impact. His loyalty and ability to deal with the sensitivities of the National Congress and the Executive Branch are qualities that I deeply admire.

                                Flávio Goulart has always demonstrated an exceptional ability to forge partnerships between companies and civil society organizations, focusing on concrete results. He played a decisive role in bringing SPVS and large corporations such as BAT and JTI closer together, which allowed for significant advances in the corporate environmental agenda, including the restoration of 350 hectares with support from BNDES and LIFE Biodiversity certification.

                                With dedication and a transformative vision, Flávio was essential in the creation and execution of the pilot project that introduced the Rural Professional Apprenticeship Program in the Family Agricultural Schools (EFAs) of Rio Grande do Sul. This pioneering work paved the way for a new educational model in the EFAs, inspiring initiatives throughout Brazil and contributing to the change in the Apprenticeship Law.
